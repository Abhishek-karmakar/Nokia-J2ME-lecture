Java ME for Education


Trainer’s handbook 
v. 1.0

Overview of the course

The objective of the reference course is to learn Java ME development for Java enabled mobile handsets supporting Java ME application framework. The course goes through the fundamental concepts and key APIs used for Java ME application development. After the course, the students are able to:
•	Understand the essential concepts of Java ME and MIDP development and 
•	Independently develop Java ME applications 
•	Utilize the most important APIs and concepts of Java ME development
•	Use NetBeans development tool competently
•	Create installation packages and deploy applications on Java ME enabled handsets

Course material


This material package consists of the following items.
1.	Trainer’s handbook
2.	Slides
3.	Hands-on exercises with incremental development of a complete game application
4.	Exercise solution code by modules
5.	Screen capture video of the final exercise application

Reference timing of the course
